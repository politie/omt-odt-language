# Welcome to the `omt-odt-language` VS Code Extension

## What's in the repository

### The root of the repository

- `.*` - configuration files
- `CHANGELOG` - where we keep a comprehensive list of all the
  changes to the extension
- `LICENSE` - for reference
- `logo.png` - a logo for the extension in the marketplace
- `package.json` - the manifest file declaring all capabilities of the extension
- `README.md` - for users
- `tsconfig.json` - configuration for typescript compilation
  for the client and server code
- this file for the extension's developers

### The `client` folder

This folder contains the extension code that will be run on the client.
It will start and connect to the server defined in `/server`.
The client features can be tested by running `npm run test` from the
workspace root. It will use the  LSP server to provide these features:

- Document Link
  - OMT imports with paths

### The `configurations` folder

This folder contains all language configurations.
These files end in `.language-configuration.json` and
control declarative language features:

- Comment toggling
- Brackets definition
- Autoclosing
- Autosurrounding
- Folding
- Word pattern
- Indentation Rules

For more information on language configuration,
have a look at the [Language Configuration Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-configuration-guide).

## The `server` folder

This folder contains all the code run as a node server.
It provides the language server functionality using the
LSP protocol for the client plugin and is started
by the extension in `/client`. The features currently implemented are:

- Document link for OMT imports with:
  - Relative paths
  - Paths beginning with a @Shorthand
  - Declared OMT imports as empty paths with data to be resolved
- Go to Definition
  - Works for imported and declared objects
  - Based on text

### The `snippets` folder

This folder contains all code snippets.
These files end in `*.snippets.json` and define snippets that can be inserted
and filled out for the developer's convenience.

For more information on snippets, see the [Snippet Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/snippet-guide).

### The `syntaxes` folder

This folder contains all TextMate grammar files for syntax highlighting.
These files end in `*.tmLanguage.json` and define the tokens which make up
the language and the scopes they are assigned.

For more information on grammar files,
see the [Syntax Highlight Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide)
and [TextMate Language Grammars](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars).

## Testing the plugin

- Press `F5` to open an *Extension Development Host*,
  a VSCode window with the extension loaded.
- Create a new file with file name suffix `.omt` or `.odt`.
- Verify that syntax highlighting works and that the
  language configuration settings are working.

## Make changes

- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar
    after making changes to the files listed above.
- You can also reload the VS Code window with your extension
  to load your changes with `Ctrl+R` (windows) or `âŒ˜ R` (macOS).

## Add more language features

> As of 2.8.5, the CD workflow is in place on Github.
> This workflow automatically publishes new versions of the plugin,
> as they are merged into `main`.
> The package.json version is checked to see whether an update is necessary.
> Remember to update the package.json and package-lock.json versions,
> and add to the CHANGELOG.md.
